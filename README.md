Class, 
A class describes a real-world object and acts as a template for objects. An object is a component within the class, following attributed within the class. A class has no memory allocated for it, whereas an object does. A class is logical, whereas an object is physical. A class can only be declared once, while an object can be used over and over again. For example, the class is a dog whose objects would be name, age, breed, etc.
