Class, 

A class represents a real-world object and acts as a template or blueprint that defines the overall structure of that object. It contains variables and methods that describe what an object should have and do. However, a class itself does not store any data or occupy memory; it simply serves as a guide for creating objects.

An object, on the other hand, is an instance of a class that follows its structure. Unlike a class, an object takes up memory and can be reused multiple times. Although many objects can be instantiated from the same class, the class itself is defined only once within a file.

For my discussion project, I am using a Dachshund as an example. The class represents the general concept of a dachshund, but on its own, it is not specific enough. That’s where attributes come in, they define details such as the dog’s name, age, color, and size. For example, two objects created from the Dachshund class could be:
Dog1 = Gxxie, 3, Red, Mini
Dog2 = Maple, 1, Brown/Tan, Mini

These objects follow the same class structure but have unique values, demonstrating how a class serves as a blueprint while objects bring it to life.
